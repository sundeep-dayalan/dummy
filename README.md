# MONET ‚Äî One-Click Azure Functions (Node.js)

## üöÄ One-Click Deploy to Azure

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsundeep-dayalan%2FMONET%2Fdummy%2Fazuredeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)

What this does:
- Provisions a Storage Account, a Consumption Plan, an Azure Functions app (Node 18), and Application Insights
- Hooks the Function App to this GitHub repo/branch and builds from `src` using Oryx (Kudu)

How to verify after deployment (3‚Äì10 minutes):
1) In Azure Portal, open the new Function App, copy the default hostname (Overview page)
2) Open in a browser:

```
https://<your-func-app-hostname>/api/hello?name=MONET
```

Expected response:

```
Hello, MONET! This is a Node.js TypeScript function deployed from GitHub.
```

Local development (from `src/`):

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Troubleshooting:
- First request may 404 until the initial build completes; wait 1‚Äì2 minutes and retry
- Check Function App > Deployment Center for Oryx build logs
- Required app settings are set by the template: `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME=node`, `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=~18`, `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`, `WEBSITE_PROJECT_PATH=src`
